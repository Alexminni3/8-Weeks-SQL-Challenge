## Business Task
Danny is expanding his new Pizza Empire and at the same time, he wants to Uberize it, so Pizza Runner was launched.

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## Objective
In Week 2, the focus is on cleaning and transforming raw operational data from Pizza Runner’s delivery system. The goal is to convert messy and inconsistent inputs into a structured format suitable for analysis using SQL.

Key Tasks
Clean and format the customer_orders and runner_orders tables.

## Handle:

Nulls and missing values

Inconsistent data entries (e.g., "null", "NaN", empty strings)

String parsing (e.g., toppings, cancellation flags, duration/time formats)

Transform strings into separate rows or columns to enable deeper insights.

## Skills Demonstrated
Data Cleaning with CASE, TRIM, NULLIF, REPLACE, and CAST

String manipulation with SPLIT_PART, STRING_TO_ARRAY, and UNNEST (PostgreSQL)

CTEs and temporary transformation logic

Experience in turning unstructured data into a relational format
